## Steps for setting up this repo:

1. First you will need to clone this repo. `git clone https://github.com/mjs001/todo-frontend.git`.
2. Next `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Next, you need to create a .env file with a variable called: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT`. If you did not specify a port variable in the backend it will need to be: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT=5000`. Otherwise, you can set it to the custom port you set in the backend.
